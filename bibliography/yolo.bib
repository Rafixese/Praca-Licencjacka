  abstract={Object recognition is one of the challenging application of computer vision, which has been widely applied in many areas for e.g. autonomous cars, Robotics, Security tracking, Guiding Visually Impaired Peoples etc. With the rapid development of deep learning many algorithms were improving the relationship between video analysis and image understanding. All these algorithms work differently with their network architecture but with the same aim of detecting multiple objects within complex image. Absence of vision impairment restraint the movement of the person in an unfamiliar place and hence it is very essential to take help from our technologies and trained them to guide blind peoples whenever they need. This paper proposes a system that will detect every possible day to day multiple objects on the other hand promt a voice to alert person about the near as well as farthest objects around them. In this paper system is developed using two different algorithms i.e. Yolo and Yolo_v3 and tested under same criterias to measure the accuracy and performance. In Yolo Tensor flow _SSD _Mobile Net model and in Yolo_v3 Dark net model is used. To get the audio Feedback gTTS (Google Text to Speech), python library used to convert statements into audio speech. To play the audio pygame python module is used. Testing of both the algorithms is done on MS-COCO Dataset consist of more than 200 K images. Both the algorithms are analysed using webcam in various situations to measure accuracy of the algorithm in every possibility.},

	abstract={Because there are various unsafe factors on the road, the testing of the virtual environment is an important part of the automatic driving technology. This paper presents a CARLA vehicle and its distance detection system in a virtual environment. Based on the existing Yolo v5s neural network structure, this paper proposes a new neural network structure Yolo v5-Ghost. Adjusted the network layer structure of Yolo v5s. The computational complexity is reduced, and the proposed neural network structure is more suitable for embedded devices. After testing the new network structure, the detection accuracy of Yolo v5s is 83.36%mAP(mean Average Precision), the detection speed is 28.57FPS (Frames Per Second), and the detection accuracy of Yolo v5-Ghost is 80.76%mAP, the detection speed is 47.62FPS. The paper also detects the vehicle distance based on the pictures obtained by the monocular camera in the CARLA virtual environment. The detected distance error is about 5% on average.},

	abstract={In practical applications, the number of category in object detection is always single. In this paper, an efficient YOLO-compact network designed for single category real-time object detection is proposed. This paper first explored a series of methods for converting a large and deep network to a compact and efficient network, through a series of ablation experiments. Then these methods were assembled to YOLOv3 network, which obtains the YOLO-compact's infrastructure. A network structure design approach that separates the down sampling layer from all network modules was proposed, which facilitates the modular design of the network. The shortcut structure in the RFB module is changed to the direct connection structure, and the 1×3+3×1+3×3 convolution structure is used instead of 5×5 convolution, which obtains efficient RFB-c module. The residual bottleneck block has been improved, by removing the last 1×1 convolution layer and using 3×3 depth wise separable convolution. Since pedestrian is the most representative object in practical applications, this paper uses the result on person category in VOC2007 test set to represent the network performance. The model size of YOLO-compact is only 9MB, which is 3.7 times smaller than tiny-yolov3, 6.7 times smaller than tiny-yolov2, and 26 times smaller than YOLOv3. The AP result of YOLO-compact is 86.85%, which is 37% higher than tiny-yolov3, 32% higher than tiny-yolov2, and even 2.7% higher than the YOLOv3.},

	abstract={In the past three years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved promising results in detecting skin cancer. However, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the automatic detection of melanoma is still urgent due to the visual similarity of benign and malignant dermoscopic images. There is also a need for fast and computationally effective systems for mobile applications targeting caregivers and homes. This paper presents the You Only Look Once (Yolo) algorithms, which are based on DCNNs applied to the detection of melanoma. The Yolo algorithms comprise YoloV1, YoloV2, and YoloV3, whose methodology first resets the input image size and then divides the image into several cells. According to the position of the detected object in the cell, the network will try to predict the bounding box of the object and the class confidence score. Our test results indicate that the mean average precision (mAP) of Yolo can exceed 0.82 with a training set of only 200 images, proving that this method has great advantages for detecting melanoma in lightweight system applications.},
